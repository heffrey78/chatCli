    "content": "As a Node.js expert, here's a high-level plan to create an Express application that communicates with the Notion API, saves a journal entry to a table, and returns the link to the new page:\n\n1. Set up a new Node.js project:\n   - Initialize a new project using `npm init`\n   - Install needed dependencies: `npm install express axios`\n   - Optionally, install `nodemon` for live-reloading during development\n\n2. Create an Express application that listens on port 4201:\n   - Import Express and create a new instance of the app\n   - Define a route (e.g., POST `/journal-entry`) to handle journal entry requests\n   - Start the server using `app.listen(4201)` to listen on port 4201\n\n3. Communicate with the Notion API:\n   - Create an account on https://www.notion.com and get your API key\n   - Set up a new integration and grant access to your desired workspace\n   - Retrieve the required database/table ID from Notion\n   - Install the `axios` package to handle HTTP requests: `npm install axios`\n   - Create a wrapper module to handle API requests to Notion with your credentials\n\n4. Save journal entries to the table in Notion:\n   - In the Express route handler, parse the journal entry from the request\n   - Use the Notion API wrapper to create a new page as a child of the table with the required properties (date, entry text, etc.)\n   - Handle possible errors (e.g., page creation failure, invalid journal entry)\n\n5. Return the link to the new page:\n   - Extract the new page's URL from the API response after creating the page\n   - Send this URL back to the client as a response (e.g., as JSON or plain text)\n\n6. Test the application, and deploy it once everything is working correctly.\n\nRemember that this is just a high-level plan. I highly recommend using the Notion API documentation and Express documentation as references while implementing your application. Good luck!"
