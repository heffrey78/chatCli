I will demonstrate an example solution below, assuming that `handlePrompt` is part of a \"prompt handler\" module.\n\nFirst, create the IoC container:\n\n```javascript\n// Filename: ioc_container.js\n\nclass IoCContainer {\n  constructor() {\n    this.dependencies = {};\n  }\n\n  register(dependencyName, constructorFn) {\n    this.dependencies[dependencyName] = constructorFn;\n  }\n\n  resolve(dependencyName) {\n    if (!this.dependencies.hasOwnProperty(dependencyName)) throw new Error(`Unregistered dependency: ${dependencyName}`);\n\n    return this.dependencies[dependencyName]();\n  }\n}\n\nmodule.exports = new IoCContainer();\n```\n\nNow, let's register the prompt handler in the IoC container:\n\n```javascript\n// Filename: prompt_handler.js\n\nclass PromptHandler {\n  async handlePrompt(prompt, messages) {\n    // Your existing handlePrompt logic goes here\n  }\n}\n\nconst iocContainer = require('./ioc_container');\niocContainer.register('promptHandler', () => new PromptHandler());\n```\n\nWith this setup, you can use the IoC container to resolve and use the prompt handler in your application:\n\n```javascript\n// Filename: index.js\n\nconst iocContainer = require('./ioc_container');\nconst promptHandler = iocContainer.resolve('promptHandler');\n\nasync function main() {\n  // Example usage of the prompt handler\n  const prompt = 'Enter your name:';\n  const messages = ['Hello, my name is...'];\n  await promptHandler.handlePrompt(prompt, messages);\n}\n\nmain();\n```\n\nTo load new functionality at runtime, simply create new modules, register them in the IoC container, and use the `resolve` method to get their instances. Here, I demonstrated this process using the `PromptHandler`, but you can follow the same pattern for other functionalities too. Remember to change the comments with file names and paths as per your convention."
